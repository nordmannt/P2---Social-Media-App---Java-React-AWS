```

### Setup Instructions

##### Backend Setup:
1. Install Java (JDK 17 or higher).
2. Install and set up a SQL database
3. Configure database settings in `application properties` in the socialmedia folder under the src folder
4. Navigate to the backend directory and build the project
   mac
   ```bash
   cd  backend
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
   windows
   ```bash
   cd  backend
   .\mvnw clean install
   ```
6. Run the backend server:
   mac
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   windows
   ```bash
   .\mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
##### Frontend Setup:
1. Install Node.js (version 16 or higher).
2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
1. Access the application through http://localhost:3000 after inital frontend / backend setup
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credientals
3. Explore
  * Edit your profiile
  * Create posts
  * Interact with other profiles and posts

## Deployment
### Prerequisites
1. Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
2. MySQL: Set up a MySQL database server with the required schema and credentials.
3. AWS S3: Configure an S3 bucket with appropriate permissions for storing and retrieving media files. Ensure you have your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Bucket Name ready.
4. Jenkins: Install and configure Jenkins on your system or server. Install the required plugins like Docker, Git, and Maven.

### Deployment Details
The backend of this project is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, while the frontend is deployed as a static website on an AWS S3 bucket. The following instructions provide a generalized deployment approach for the backend. Note that this is just one possible method; feel free to adapt it to your specific needs.
### Steps to deploy Backend
1. Use Maven to package the application into a runnable JAR file:
```bash
./mvnw clean package
```
For windows
```bash
.\mvnw clean package
```
After the build completes, the JAR file will be located in the target folder, typically named something like socialnetwork-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
2. Use the dockerfile ti build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t socialnetwork-backend .
```
3. Run
```bash 
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
      -e DB_URL='${DB_URL}' \
      -e DB_USERNAME='${DB_USERNAME}' \
      -e DB_PASSWORD='${DB_PASSWORD}' \
      -e JWT_SECRET='${JWT_SECRET}' \
      -e S3_ACCESS_KEY='${S3_ACCESS_KEY}' \
      -e S3_SECRET_KEY='${S3_SECRET_KEY}' \
      -e S3_REGION='${S3_REGION}' \
      -e S3_BUCKET_NAME='${S3_BUCKET_NAME}' \
      -e MAIL_FROM='${MAIL_FROM}' \
      -e MAIL_HOST='${MAIL_HOST}' \
      -e MAIL_PORT='${MAIL_PORT}' \
      -e MAIL_USERNAME='${MAIL_USERNAME}' \
      -e MAIL_PASSWORDd='${MAIL_PASSWORD}' \
      -e ALLOWED_ORIGINS='${ALLOWED_ORIGINS}' \
      --name socialmedia
```
Replace placeholders like <db_host>, your_jwt_secret, your_aws_access_key, etc., with the actual values.
### Steps tp Deploy Frontend
1. Build the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory and build the static assets:
```bash   
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
```
This will generate a build folder containing the static files.

2. Upload to AWS S3:
   * to the AWS Management Console and select S3.
   * Create a new bucket or choose an existing one.
   * Enable Static Website Hosting for the bucket and specify the entry point (index.html) and error document (index.html).
   * Upload the contents of the build folder to the S3 bucket.
3. Set Bucket Permissions:
* Go to the Permissions tab of the bucket and ensure that the bucket policy allows public read access.
* Example bucket policy:
```json   
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
   "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": "*",
   "Action": "s3:GetObject",
   "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
   }
   ]
}
```
4.	Access the Frontend:
   * static website will now be accessible via the Endpoint URL provided in the S3 bucketâ€™s Static Website Hosting settings.

### Steps to automate the deployement using Jenkins (Optional)
1.	Install Jenkins Plugins 
   * Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins. 
   * Install the following plugins:
   * Docker 
   * Git 
   * Maven Integration
2. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job 
 * Go to New Item > Pipeline. 
 * Name the job and select Pipeline as the project type.
3.	Configure Source Code Management
 * Add your Git repository URL under the Source Code Management section.
 * Provide the branch name (e.g., main).
4.	Add Build Steps	
 * Use the Jenkinsfiles provided, or create your own Jenkinsfile.
5. Save and Build
 * Save the Jenkins job and click on Build Now to test the deployment pipeline.
